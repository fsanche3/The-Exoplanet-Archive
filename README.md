## Description

The Exoplanet Archive was created to retrieve and present automated confirmed exoplanet discoveries from NASA's exoplanet API. The main idea behind it was to present the data in a simple manner with the help of data visualization. I thought of this idea while watching a video on an exoplanet discovery and found myself wanting to get a better idea of where the planet is relative to its sun. Today I find myself refering to this website when I encounter new discoveries and the data visuliazation helps me build a mental 
image of the exoplanet and its properties.
